# emotions-of-sentences
This repository is for me (and maybe for you) to understand a very simple NLP task: detecting if a given sentence is positive or negative. GloVe's pretrained word vectors are used. Both NumPy and Keras are used. This has a very small training set, but pretrained vectors are sufficient to get a decent accuracy. I used 300 dimensional GloVe vector. More dimension means more accuracy in this case. Download GloVe from [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) (glove.6B.zip) and put it into data folder.
